Notes:

	webpack: for bundling our code in one js file
	babel: to convert es6 into es5 understandable code. Basicly giving me es6.
		babel-loader: loading babel files
		less-loader: 
			Needs: style-loader, css-loader: append CSS to index.html
	draggable click: is set to false as a default
	array: look up docs: 
		map: array prototype, higher order function
		passing down images as props

Questions: 
Npm build: /public/index.html: 
		Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
		Do I get rid of manifest.json?
registerServiceWorker: 
		After npm build, do I still need this?
Webpack.config.js: 
		make sure the routes are set up right.
